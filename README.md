# The following files are scripts used for work and / or personal use. 
# xml_to_excel converts an xml file to an excel file.
# After that conversion, excel_to_json converts the excel to a .json file used as a config in Azure BLOB (this was a work-specific project).

# bitmap.py is used for a personal hobby. 
# I like to screen print t-shrts.
# When burning a slik screen, the details need to be very fine for a successful process. 
# My work has become more advanced lately and I needed a means to convert portrait images into .bmp files. 
# Instead of purchasing Adboe Photoshop to automatically perform this process, I wrote python code instead.
# Therefore, bitmap.py converts any .jpg image into a # .bmp file, which in turn allows me to screen print successfully. 
# For example, I was able to screen print a portrait of Kobe Bryant onto a t-shirt. 
# Really happy I can use my coding skills as a hobby.
